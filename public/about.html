            <p class="aboutSection"> Coverly was created to assist you in creating a cover letter based on a job description and some personal qualities.</p>
            <br />
            <p class="aboutSection"> I thought of this idea due to the fact that cover letters were required in most job applications and it was always the most time consuming process. By the use of AI you can have it create you a decently structured cover letter, and even touch up pre-existing documents. I feel as though the advancement of AI in our society will continue to change the way we approach work in our daily lives, as well as how we interact with each other. I have been passionate about learning new technologies for most of my life and so when I have seen other AI applications being produced I felt like I wanted to create my very own version, that's where Coverly comes in. Powered by Google's Gemini, the web application uses the APIs provided by Google to receive a response based on the user's entered information. I hope this web app can help out many others in their job searching endeavors and if you're interested, check out my personal link below!</p>
