# Coverly

Coverly is a web application that will take in a job description and some personal qualities and skills from an individual. This combined information along with some other information about formatting will be sent to Google's Gemini API which will then form a cover letter based on this information and respond with the appropiate response.

This web application should help individuals who would like to apply for jobs that require cover letters but do not have the experience or time to make cover letters from scratch. Cover letters are often the most time consuming section of the job application process, and this app aims to improve this experience!
